## Getting Useful Data

### Logs

Multi-scrobbeler has a real-time log shown in the dashboard. These are the same logs you would find in docker logs. In the dashboard, logs can be filtered by LEVELS to give you a better view of errors/warnings.

When creating an issue please include all logs at the lowest level possible (DEBUG) to help provide context for your issue. You should try to include logs that occurred *before* and *after* your issue/error occurs as this can help determine if MS was behaving normally.

### Debug Mode

If possible, turn on [**Debug Mode**](/configuration#debug-mode) and replicate your issue. Debug Mode enables *much more* logging that can reveal additional data for troubleshooting.

This mode will make your logs very noisy, though, so it's recommended to turn it off after collecting logs.

### Copy Play Debug Data

From the dashboard, each Source/Client has a few details page links:

<img src={require('/img/details.jpg').default} height="400"/>

Opening the details page for the Source/Client reveals a lists all of the Plays that were discovered (Sources) or scrobbled (Clients).

Click on the Debug icon to copy debugging data relevant to that Play. This data should be included in any issue you create.

<img src={require('/img/debug_button.jpg').default} height="400"/>

To include this data in an issue either paste the copied data into a text file and save as `debugdata.json`, attaching to the issue.

Or directly paste the copied data into an issue/comment using [**fenced code blocks**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#fenced-code-blocks) markdown to preserve the structure like:

````
This is the contents of my comment/issue text on github.

I am explaining my issue here. Here is the debug data:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "aProperty: 123,
    "foo": "bar"
  }
}
```

Thank you for your time.
