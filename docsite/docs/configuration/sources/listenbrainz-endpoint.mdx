This Source enables multi-scrobbler to accept scrobbles from outside applications as if it was a Listenbrainz server.

:::tip[Other Uses]

* To **scrobble to** Listenbrainz, create a [Listenbrainz (Client)](/configuration/clients/listenbrainz)
* To monitor and re-scrobble activity from your Listenbrainz account, create a [Listenbrainz (Source)](/configuration/sources/listenbrainz-source)

:::

##### URL

If a **slug** is **not** provided in configuration then multi-scrobbler will accept Listenbrainz scrobbles at

```
http://localhost:9078/1/submit-listens
```

which is the "standard" Listenbrainz server path for scrobbling.

Use a slug only if you need to setup multiple Listenbrainz Endpoint sources and cannot use different tokens.

If a slug is used then the URL will be:

```
http://localhost:9078/api/listenbrainz/mySlug
```

:::note
    Some Listenbrainz applications may require custom Listenbrainz URLs to be a real domain (`example.com`) and/or use SSL (`https://`). In this case you should setup multi-scrobbler behind a reverse proxy to support this functionality. It is out of the scope of this project to do this solely within multi-scrobbler.
:::

##### Token

Most Listenbrainz clients require a token (Authentication Token) to be provided during setup. This value can be anything you want, just make sure to use the same value for `token` in your multi-scrobbler configuration for the endpoint.
