Parse metadata from any Icecast Station (streams) to use for scrobbling.

:::note

There is no standard format for presenting track information in an Icecast stream and the majority of streams that do include metadata only use a single string (`StreamTitle`) from which metadata can be parsed.

Multi-scrobbler will do its best to parse Artist/Album/Track information from this data but the quality and consistency for this is solely based on how the Icecast broadcaster chooses to format their tracks.

:::

Multi-scrobbler cannot automatically determine if you are listening to a Station. Therefore, **automatic scrobbling for Icecast Sources is off by default.** Use **Should Scrobble Behavior** to initiate scrobbling or configure automatic scrobble.

<ShouldScrobble filename="icecast"/>

:::tip[Scrobbling Threshold]

Icecast does not report track lengths so multi-scrobbler cannot determine if it should scrobble based on percent played. You should instead set a shorter "listened to" **duration** using [Scrobble Thresholds.](/configuration/sources#scrobble-thresholds)

#### URL and Sources

The URL should be the URL you would use to stream audio. 

Additional sources are supported based on those found in [`icecast-metadata-stats`](https://github.com/eshaz/icecast-metadata-js/tree/main/src/icecast-metadata-stats#supported-status-apis). To use these with automatic parsing [based on the regular URL](https://github.com/eshaz/icecast-metadata-js/tree/main/src/icecast-metadata-stats#options) include a `sources` array in your config the same way as shown in `icecast-metadata-stats`:

<details>

    <summary>Example</summary>

```json5 title="config.json"
[
    {
      "name": "myIcy",
      "enable": true,
      "data": {
        "url": "http://myIcecast.com/radio",
        "sources": ["icy", "ogg", "sevenhtml"]
      }
    }
  ]
  
```
</details>

To manually set these sources include the same [`*Endpoint` options](https://github.com/eshaz/icecast-metadata-js/tree/main/src/icecast-metadata-stats#options) found in `icecast-metadata-stats`.

If no `sources` are configured for multi-scrobbler it will automatically try to use `icy` and `ogg`.
