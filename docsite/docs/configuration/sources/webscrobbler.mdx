After installing the [Webscrobbler extension](https://web-scrobbler.com/) open the preferences/settings for it:

* Under **Accounts**
  * **Add Webhook**
    * API URL: `[YourMultiScrobblerInstance]/api/webscrobbler` EX `http://localhost:9078/api/webscrobbler`
    * Application name: `(whatever you want)`

Reload the extension after adding the webhook.

:::note

* **On Firefox** - Only FQNs (domain.tld), `localhost`, and `127.0.0.1` are supported for API URL due to [firefox requiring https](https://github.com/web-scrobbler/web-scrobbler/issues/4183#issuecomment-1749222006)
* **On Chromium-based Browsers** - Any domain will work for API URL
* All other browsers are untested

:::warning

Multi-scrobbler is **not** designed to be publicly accessible from the internet. To use Webscrobbler outside your local network you should be accessing MS through a VPN or through a reverse proxy with some kind of authentication (though this is still not recommended).

### Multiple Users

If you would like use multiple WebScrobbler sources they can be matched using a **slug** at the end of the **API URL.** This requires using [a file-based config.](/configuration?configType=file#configuration-types)

<details>

    <summary>Example</summary>

    ```json title="webscrobbler.json"
    [
      {
        "name": "aUserWS",
        "clients": [
          "client1Maloja"
        ],
        "data": {
          "slug": "usera"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "bUserWS",
        "clients": [
          "client2Maloja"
        ],
        "data": {
          "slug": "userb"
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    * To use `aUserWS` source set **API URL** to `http://localhost:9078/api/webscrobbler/usera`
    * To use `bUserWS` source set **API URL** to `http://localhost:9078/api/webscrobbler/userb`

    :::tip

    `http://localhost:9078/api/webscrobbler` is matched with the first source that _that does not have a slug defined._

### Connectors Black/Whitelist

MS can be configured to only scrobble, or NOT scrobble, from some WS connectors. Use the name of the website from the [supported websites](https://web-scrobbler.com/) or from the **Connectors** tab in the extension. 

:::note

This affects **only** MS's behavior and does not affect the general connector behavior you have configured within the WebScrobbler extension.
