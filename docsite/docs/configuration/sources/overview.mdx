## Features

### Types of Sources

The Sources implemented in multi-scrobbler can be broken down into two categories.

#### By Communication Method

How does this Source get data from the service/application?

##### Active

The MS Source makes network requests to the service which returns a response with data MS can use to monitor listening activity or scrobbles.

##### Ingress

The MS Source waits for the service/application to send data to multi-scrobbler.

These types of Sources require that multi-scrobbler is accessible to the service, generally through an open port or reverse proxy.

#### By Data Source of Truth

How does MS determine if/when a song has been played and is scrobbable?

##### Listening Activity {#activity}

These Sources expose some kind of real-time listening data for users, like:

* player state (paused, stopped, playing)
* player position (1:50/2:40)
* current listened duration (Track A playing for 1m:20s)

For theses Sources multi-scrobbler keeps track of the real-time state of your activity and scrobbles a track after it meets certain [scrobble thresholds](#scrobble-thresholds).

##### Listening History/Scrobbles {#history}

Some Sources expose their own version of "this track has been scrobbled."

* Listenbrainz, Koito, and Last.fm are all scrobble services that have "definitive" histories of scrobbled tracks.

For these Sources multi-scrobbler monitors the listening history data and scrobbles when it sees a new entry in the list.

### Multi-Device/User

Some Sources report which User is playing a track and/or on what device the track is being played. These Sources can be filtered with configuration to only monitor activity for specific devices or users.

### Limiting Scrobble Destination

By default a Source will scrobble to **all** configured Clients.

To limit which Clients a Source will scrobble to use the `clients` property in a Source's [File/AIO configuration](./?configType=file#configuration-types) to specify the **names** of the Clients that it should scrobble to:

```json5 title="jellyfin.json"
{
    "name": "MyJellyfin",
    "clients": ["myMaloja","koitoA","listenbrainzFoo"]
    "data": {
        // ...
    },
}
```

The Source above will only scrobble to Clients that are **named** (`name` property in Client config) either `myMaloja` `koitoA` or `listenbrainzFoo`.

If your Client is configured using [ENV](./?configType=env#configuration-types) then they are given an automatically generated name. Check the multi-scrobbler Dashboard to find their name in a subheader under the Client type. Example:

![Client Name Subheader](../client-subheader.png)

### Scrobble Thresholds

<ScrobbleThreshold filename="spotify"/>

These can also be configured **globally** for all Sources using ENVs:

```
SOURCE_SCROBBLE_DURATION=40
SOURCE_SCROBBLE_PERCENT=20
```

### Should Scrobble Behavior

:::note

This feature is currently available only for some Sources. Check each Source's documentation to see if it supported.

:::

For _most_ Sources multi-scrobbler can determine if a user is listening and scrobble automatically. For Sources which multi-scrobbler cannot do this or require additional configuration, a user can indicate to MS that it should or should not scrobble. This action can be taken on the Web Dashboard by clicking the link next to **Should Scrobble** found in each Source's status card.

Additionally, for these Sources, the default behavior for Scrobbling can be explicitly set by adding the following value to a Source's `options` in [file or aio config](./?configType=file#configuration-types):

```json5 title="azuracast.json"
{
    "data": {
        // ...
    },
    "options": {
        // set to true to always scrobble automatically
        // set to false to never scrobble automatically
        "systemScrobble": true
    }
}
```
