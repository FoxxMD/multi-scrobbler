import ScrobbleThreshold from "@site/src/components/snippets/_scrobble-threshold.mdx"

A **Client** is an application that stores the historical information about what songs you have played (scrobbles). Examples are **Maloja, Last.fm, Listenbrainz**...

## Features

### Dead Scrobbles

If multi-scrobbler is unable to submit a scrobble to a Client then it places the scrobble into a queue which is retried every 5 minutes for a number of times before it gives up.

After it stops _automatically_ retrying the scrobble still exists and can be retried from the dashboard. Dead scrobbles persist between restart so you will never lose a scrobble that hasn't been successfully submitted yet.

### Now Playing

Multi-scrobbler can report the currently **playing** tracks it is monitoring to some Scrobble Clients via their individual **Now Playing** functionality.

Now Playing is **default enabled** for all Clients that support it.

The behavior multi-scrobbler uses for determining Now Playing reporting:

* Now Playing can be explicitly enabled or disabled globally using ENV `NOW_PLAYING=true` or `NOW_PLAYING=false`
    * This only affects Clients that don't have behavior set via File/AIO (below)
* Now Playing will be only be reported to the same Clients a Source is configured to scrobble to
* A Source's Player status must be **Playing**, IE **active**, for reporting to occur
  * This status can be verified via Player UI on the Dashboard
* If multiple Sources having active Players then the scrobble Client will default to reporting the track based on Source **configuration** name, alphabetically
  * This is the `name` property set in [File or AIO source configs](/configuration?configType=file#configuration-types)

Clients can customize the Now Playing behavior individually using [File or AIO source configs:](/configuration?configType=file#configuration-types)
