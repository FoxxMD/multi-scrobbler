:::tip[Other Uses]

To monitor and re-scrobble activity from a ATProto Profile create a [teal.fm (Source)](/configuration/sources/tealfm-source)

:::

[**teal.fm**](https://teal.fm/) is a social discovery and web viewing service for scrobbles stored/available on the ATProto network/your repository in a [PDS (Personal Data Server)](https://github.com/Bluesky-social/pds).

<details>

<summary>How does that work?</summary>

The [AT Protocol](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto) is a standard to allow different applications to share and interpret your social data.

Your data is stored in a personal [repository](https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos) in a [PDS (Personal Data Server)](https://github.com/Bluesky-social/pds), which is data-type agnostic (it's just JSON). Each application defines their own datatypes and pulls data from your repository to render to you, your network, etc...

Even though the application and the PDS/repository are independent, all of this is done for you automatically when you create a [Bluesky](https://bsky.social/about) account.

So...

* multi-scrobbler "scrobbles" your plays to your repository
  * in a JSON data structure which includes [teal.fm's data type and structure](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon)
  * at a [known location for teal.fm's data](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#collection) (`fm.teal.alpha.feed.play`), in a list that is appended to as you continue to scrobble
* when accessing teal.fm, or another application that knows how to read it, your data is pulled from the repository to render the app

</details>

:::warning

The default Bluesky PDS is **public**, meaning your scrobbles are also public (read-only). This isn't any different than using Last.fm or Listenbrainz, in terms of privacy.

Multi-scrobbler lets you define a different **PDS** so you can store your scrobbles on **any** ATProto PDS/instance you have access to.

:::

:::note

[teal.fm is still in developement](https://notes.teal.fm/3lzlwe6puis2l) and does not have a public website, yet.

To view your teal.fm scrobbles you can:

* use [wrapped.baileytownsend.dev](https://wrapped.baileytownsend.dev/) which gives a simple stats overview of your scrobbles
* use [atproto.at](https://atproto.at) to view the raw data (convenience URLs are generated in multi-scrobbler for you to do this)
