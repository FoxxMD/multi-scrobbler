This scrobbler uses **[Now Playing](/configuration/clients#now-playing)** functionality to set your Discord [Rich Presence](https://docs.discord.com/developers/rich-presence/overview) to the music you are currently monitoring with multi-scrobbler.

<img src={require('/img/discord_presence_art.png').default} height="127"/>

This integration is **headless**, it does not depend on any specific Discord application to be running.

:::warning[Discord TOS Violation]

This functionality requires you to use your own **User Token** in a way that is **against Discord's policies/terms of service.** If you use this scrobbler you do so **at your risk**.

Refer to the **How MS Uses Discord API** section below to gauge whether this risk is acceptable to you.

:::

<DetailsAdmo type="note" summary="How MS Uses Discord API">

Multi-scrobbler does its upmost to implement, to-spec, [Gateway API communication](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway) and respect usage. It requires no [permissions](https://docs.discord.com/developers/events/gateway#gateway-intents) and reads no data other than monitoring what other user sessions are active.

Aside from the on-paper violation of using a user token programmatically (on your behalf), there is no misuse of the API to achieve rich presence.

Additionally, MS uses the state of non-MS sessions to conservatively update presence. [By default it will not conflict](#configure-when-presence-is-used) with any other official presence activities and is only used when you are actually active on a device.

</DetailsAdmo>

<DetailsAdmo type="note" summary="REQUIRED Interaction after Starting Multi-Scrobbler">

Every time multi-scrobbler is started a discord session update needs to be triggered so that [MS can capture the signals it uses to determine if presence can be updated.](#configure-when-presence-is-used) This only needs to be *once*, after starting multi-scrobbler. But it does need to be *every time* multi-scrobbler is (re)started. Without these signals MS will not update presence.

This session update can happen automatically after *some* time so you may not need to do anything. If you want to force the update then do one of the following:

* Open discord on a device it was not recently active on
* Exit discord on an active device
* Change your status (online, idle, etc...)
* Set a custom status
* Cause a presence update with a different app (listening to..., playing..., etc.)

</DetailsAdmo>

## Required Setup

### User Token

You must provide a User Token for this scrobbler to work.

<DetailsAdmo type="warning" summary="User Token is a Sensitive Credential">

Treat your User Token like a login credential. Anyone who has your token can access Discord as you.

When finding instructions for obtaining this token only run commands, or follow steps, that you can understand and trust. Do not run commands you do not understand. Never give your token to someone else.

</DetailsAdmo>

No instructions will be provided for obtaining a User Token because it is against Discord's policies to use it. Instead, you can search online for "how to obtain discord user token".

## Optional Setup

### Configure When Presence Is Used

MS uses several signals from your "real" Discord sessions to determine if it should update presence. The default configuration is conservative to ensure that MS does not conflict with other apps using presence. Additionally, it only updates if a "real" user device is active on discord.

:::tip[TLDR]

Without any additional configuration, MS will only update presence if:

* you have discord open on a real device
* your status is either: online, idle, or dnd (not invisible)
* no other apps are broadcasting listening activities (listening to spotify, etc...)

:::

#### Online Status

Configure if MS is allowed to update presence based on your online status. If this setting is not defined MS will only update if your status is **online**, **idle**, or **dnd**.

Allowed Values: `online` `idle` `dnd` `invisible`

<details>

<summary>Example</summary>

Only allow presence updating when all of your "real" sessions are either online or idle.


In File/AIO:

```json
[
    {
      "name": "MS",
      "enable": true,
      "data": {
        "token": "Ma7XBvzRERK3gQdkX4dkb3OQ.6aaGmJ.rvFiiVrzG4VXHHL3LyhZYhpWdG3Ph_if9aKz5E",
        "applicationId": "8190211179716453570",
        "statusOverrideAllow": ["online", "idle"]
      }
    }
  ]
```

In ENV:

```
DISCORD_STATUS_OVERRIDE_ALLOW=online,idle
```

</details>

#### Other Listening Activities

Without any additional configuration, MS will not set Rich Presence if **other** apps are broadcasting **listening** activities EX "Listening to Spotify".

<details>

<summary>What about other activity types?</summary>

Discord uses an undocumented activity type priority to determine what activity is shown "first" for your profile. The Listening activity type has the *lowest priority*.

This means that if you start any other type of activity (streaming, watching, competing, etc...) it will take precedence over MS's listening activity.

Your listening activity will still be visible by clicking into your full profile.

</details>


Configure the names of **other** listening activities that MS **is allowed** to broadcast at the same time as.

<details>

<summary>Example</summary>

You want to allow MS to update presence even if Spotify is also broadcasting a listening activity.

In File/AIO:

```json
[
    {
      "name": "MS",
      "enable": true,
      "data": {
        "token": "Ma7XBvzRERK3gQdkX4dkb3OQ.6aaGmJ.rvFiiVrzG4VXHHL3LyhZYhpWdG3Ph_if9aKz5E",
        "applicationId": "8190211179716453570",
        "listeningActivityAllow": ["spotify"]
      }
    }
  ]
```

In ENV:

```
DISCORD_LISTENING_ACTIVITY_ALLOW=spotify
```
</details>

### Discord Application

Creating a [Discord App](https://docs.discord.com/developers/quick-start/overview-of-apps) enables you to use custom album cover art and secondary status images for more links. Creating an App is free and simple, it is recommended you do this to get the most functionality from Rich Presence.

<details>

<summary>Create An Application</summary>

Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

* Click on "New Application" and give it a name
* Copy the **Application Id** (Client Id) shown after creation
* Add this Id to your Multi-Scrobbler config
  * Env Config => `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=12345678`
  * File Config => `"applicationId": "12345678"`

</details>

### Artwork

Multi-scrobbler can display Album Art in your Discord status. The image that is used differs based on if the image URL is publically accessible.

:::note

If no [**Application Id**](#discord-application) is configured the status art will **always** be the [Discord Default](./?artworkUrl=discord-default#artwork-url-types).

:::

The order in which multi-scrobbler determines what image to use is the same as the order of the tabs shown below.

#### Artwork URL Types

<Tabs groupId="artworkUrl" queryString>
        <TabItem label="External URLs" value="external">
        When [**Application Id**](#discord-application) **is** configured MS can use external URLs for artwork.

        <img src={require('/img/discord_presence_art.png').default} height="127"/>

        External URLs that are not from known music services are **disabled by default.** This is to preserve *your* privacy because Discord does not host images, it only links to them and the URL is visible to other users.

        <details>

        <summary>Why Should I Care?</summary>

        There are some scenarios where you may not want your artwork URLs to be visible, for example:

        * A Source may be accessible only on your LAN (Jellyfin at `http://192.168.0.101`)
        * A Source may be internet-facing but you do not want to expose this information to discord/other users
        * A Source may be internet-facing but requires authentication to view the image
        </details>

        MS will use your artwork URLs only if:

        * artwork url is from a known music service/[Cover Art Archive](./?artworkUrl=caa#artwork-url-types) or
        * artwork url starts with `https` and
          * `artwork` (`DISCORD_ARTWORK`) is
            * `true` => always uses the url
            * a list of custom domains keywords an external artwork url should contain EX 
               * ENV => `DISCORD_ARTWORK=mycdn,jellyfin`
               * File Config => `"artwork": ["mycdn","jellyfin"]`

        <details>

        <summary>Examples</summary>

        None of the below URLs will **ever** be used because they are not `https`

        ```
        http://foobar.com/cool.jpg <-- NOT allowed, not http
        http://192.168.0.112/fun.png <-- NOT allowed, not http
        ```

        When `DISCORD_ARTWORK` is not set:

        ```
        https://archive.org/download/dir/myimage.jpg <-- allowed, is https and known service
        https://spotify.com/assets/cover.png?size=1000 <-- allowed, is https and known service
        https://example.com/cool.jpg <-- NOT allowed, is https but not a known service and DISCORD_ARTWORK is not set
        https://anything.com/neat.jpg <-- NOT allowed, is https but not a known service and DISCORD_ARTWORK is not set
        ```

        Setting `DISCORD_ARTWORK=true`

        ```
        https://archive.org/my/dir/myimage.jpg <-- allowed, is https and known service
        http://foobar.com/cool.jpg <-- NOT allowed, not http
        https://example.com/cool.jpg <-- allowed, is https
        https://anything.com/neat.jpg <-- allowed, is https
        ```

        Setting `DISCORD_ARTWORK=mycdn,jellyfin`

        ```
        https://archive.org/my/dir/myimage.jpg <-- allowed, is https and known service
        http://foobar.com/cool.jpg <-- NOT allowed, not http
        https://example.com/cool.jpg <-- NOT allowed, is https but does not contain "mycdn" or "jellyfin"
        https://jellyfin.mydomain.com/neat.jpg <-- allowed, is https and contains "jellyfin"
        ```

        </details>


        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Musicbrainz/Cover Art Achive" value="caa">
        When [**Application Id**](#discord-application) **is** configured MS can try to use [Cover Art Archive](http://coverartarchive.org/) to get album art. The URL it retrieves is public which means it acts like an External URL that is always available for you.

        <img src={require('/img/discord_presence_art.png').default} height="127"/>
        
        MS will try to use Cover Art Archive if:
        
        * The scrobble data does not contain an album art url (no art in dashboard) or the existing url has failed an [External URL](./?artworkUrl=external#artwork-url-types) condition
        * and **the scrobble data contains a [Musicbrainz](/configuration/transforms/musicbrainz) Release (Album) MBID** 
        
        Basically, if MS would normally use the [MS Default](./?artworkUrl=ms-default#artwork-url-types) art, it will first try to use Cover Art Archive if the scrobble has a Release MBID.

        Some Source, like [Jellyfin](/configuration/sources/jellyfin) and [Plex](/configuration/sources/plex), can automatically provide this ID if the music is "matched" in your library.
        
        For all others, you can [**configure MS to use the Musicbrainz Stage**](/configuration/transforms/musicbrainz#use-metadata-for-discord-album-art) for Discord to try to get this MBID.
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="MS Default" value="ms-default">
        When [**Application Id**](#discord-application) **is** configured and these conditions are true:

        * Cannot use an [External URL](./?artworkUrl=external#artwork-url-types) and
        * Cannot get album art from [Cover Art Archive](./?artworkUrl=caa#artwork-url-types) and
        * Play does not contain artwork information (no artwork shown in dashboard)

        The status artwork will use a default URL instead of your artwork URL.
        
        Without any other configuration, the default URL is an icon from the [multi-scrobbler repository](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/blob/master/assets/default-artwork.png):

        <img src={require('/img/discord_presence_ms_default.png').default} height="127"/>

        This default image can be customized:

        * ENV Config => `DISCORD_ARTWORK_DEFAULT_URL=https://cooldomain.com/art.png`
        * File Config => `"artworkDefaultUrl": "https://cooldomain.com/art.png"`

        Remember, this URL need to be accessible on the public internet.
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Discord Default" value="discord-default">
        When [**Application Id**](#discord-application) is **not** configured Discord will show its own image. No custom artwork can be used in this configuration.

        This is also the image Discord will display if the artwork URL cannot be fetched.

        <img src={require('/img/discord_presence_discord_default.png').default} height="127"/>
        </TabItem>
</Tabs>
