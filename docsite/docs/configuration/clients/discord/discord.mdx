This scrobbler uses **[Now Playing](/configuration/clients#now-playing)** functionality to set your Discord [Rich Presence](https://docs.discord.com/developers/rich-presence/overview) to the music you are currently monitoring with multi-scrobbler.

There are two types of Discord integrations to choose from:

## Local

The **Local** integration uses an **existing** Discord application on Linux/MacOS to set Rich Presence.

* Uses "permitted" access to Discord, no TOS issues
* More restricted customization compares to Headless
* Only active when your existing Discord application is open
* For instances where Multi-Scrobbler is not on the same machine as Discord
  * Requires an additional program to relay the Discord connection
  * This is potentially insecure, or less secure, then Headless

[**Local Docs**](#/configuration/client/discord/discord-local)

## Headless

The **Headless** integration uses Discord cloud Gateway/API, directly, to set Rich Presence.

* Does not require an existing Discord application (uses Discord cloud API)
* Using this **Violates Discord TOS** because it requires a user token
* More customization than Local
* Active if **any** Discord application is online
