## Updating

Currently, multi-scrobbler does not have any databases or dependencies that require additional interaction/consideration when updating.

The majority of major/minor version releases introduce only *new* functionality but occasionally may also include breaking changes in behavior or configuration. These changes, and how to update configs accordingly, are detailed in [Github Release Notes](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/releases). It is recommended to check this page before upgrading.

Alternatively, multi-scrobbler version can be pinned using [git tags](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/tags) or docker image tags that match release versions IE `foxxmd/multi-scrobbler:0.9.7`

### Docker

<Tabs groupId="runType" queryString>
    <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">
        ```shell
        docker image pull foxxmd/multi-scrobbler:latest
        docker container stop multi-scrobbler
        docker container rm multi-scrobbler
        docker run --name multi-scrobbler ...
        ```
        The last command is the [same as the command used to initialy run multi-scrobbler.](../installation/installation.mdx?runType=docker#docker-usage-example)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
        ```shell
        docker compose pull
        docker compose up -d
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Nodejs

Assuming the [repository was used for initial installation with `git clone`](../installation/installation.mdx#nodejs), update by pulling the latest commit:

```
git pull
```

and restart multi-scrobbler.
