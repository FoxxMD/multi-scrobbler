**Why should I use this over a browser extension and/or mobile app scrobbler?**

* **Platform independent** -- Because multi-scrobbler communicates directly with service APIs it will scrobble everything you play regardless of where you play it. No more need for apps on every platform you use!
* **Open-source** -- Get peace of mind knowing exactly how your personal data is being handled.
* **Track your activity regardless of where you listen** -- Scrobble from many Sources to one Client with ease and without duplicating tracks.
* **Manage scrobbling for others** -- Scrobble for your friends and family without any setup on their part. Easily silo sources to specific clients to keep plays separate.

**But I already scrobble my music to Last.fm/ListenBrainz, is multi-scrobbler for me?**

Yes! You can use [Last.fm as a **Source**](docs/configuration#lastfm-source) or [Listenbrainz as a **Source**](docs/configuration#listenbrainz-source) to forward scrobbles from your profile to any other Client! That way you can keep your current scrobble setup as-is but still get the benefit of capturing your data to a self-hosted location.

## How Does multi-scrobbler (MS) Work?

You set up configurations for one or more **Sources** and one or more **Clients**. MS monitors all of your configured **Sources**. When new tracks are played by a Source it grabs that information and then sends it (scrobbles it) to all **Clients** that Source is configured to scrobble to.

### Source

A **Source** is a data source that contains information about tracks you are playing like a music player or platform. Examples are **Spotify, Jellyfin, Plex, Youtube Music, Airsonic**, etc...

Source configurations consist of:

* A friendly name.
* Any data needed to communicate or authenticate with the Source.
* An optional list of Client names that the Source should scrobble to. If omitted the Source also scrobbles to all configured Clients.

### Client

A **Client** is an application that stores the historical information about what songs you have played (scrobbles). Examples are **Maloja, Last.fm, Listenbrainz**...

Client configurations consist of:

* A friendly name.
* Any data needed to communicate or authenticate with the Client.

## Quick Start

[See the **Quick Start Guide**](docs/quickstart)

## Installation

[See the **Installation** documentation](docs/installation)

## Configuration

[See the **Configuration** documentation](docs/configuration)

## Usage

A status page with statistics, recent logs, and some runtime configuration options can be found at

```
http://localhost:9078
```
Output is also provided to stdout/stderr as well as file if specified in configuration.

On first startup you may need to authorize Spotify and/or Last.fm by visiting the callback URL (which can also be accessed from the status page). Visit the status page above to find the applicable link to trigger this.
