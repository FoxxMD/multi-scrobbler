<DetailsAdmo type="warning" summary="Insecure Communication">

This method of exposing Discord IPC is **not secure**. There is no authentication used for the traffic relayed to/from the opened TCP port.

You should only use this method if you trust the network your machine is on. Additionally:

* **Do** use a firewall to limit source (IP) of incoming traffic to this TCP port
* **Do not** expose this port to the public internet
