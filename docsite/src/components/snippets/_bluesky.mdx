The [AT Protocol](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto) is a standard to allow different applications to share and interpret your social data.

Your data is stored in a personal [repository](https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos) in a [PDS (Personal Data Server)](https://github.com/Bluesky-social/pds), which is data-type agnostic (it's just JSON). Each application defines their own datatypes and pulls data from your repository to render to you, your network, etc...

Even though the application and the PDS/repository are independent, all of this is done for you automatically when you create a [Bluesky](https://bsky.social/about) account.

So...

* multi-scrobbler "scrobbles" your plays to your repository
  * in a JSON data structure which includes [{props.name}'s data type and structure](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon)
  * at a [known location for {props.name}'s data](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#collection) (<CodeInline>{props.lexicon}</CodeInline>), in a list that is appended to as you continue to scrobble
* when accessing {props.name}, or another application that knows how to read it, your data is pulled from the repository to render the app
