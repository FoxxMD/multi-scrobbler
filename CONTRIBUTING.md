# Creating a Pull Request

Please follow these guidelines when contributing code to this repository:

* Use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) format when creating commits.
* Preferably, please use a [feature branch](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39586780/1469797) instead of committing directly to `master`.
* Ensure that if your code is covered by [an existing test](./src/backend/tests) that you have updated the test accordingly
