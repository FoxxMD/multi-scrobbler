        Please copy and paste any/all relevant from the DEBUG level log output. 
        Even if your issue does not seem to be shown in the logs you should still add as much detail as possible, a _lack_ of issues in logs may be a good hint during debugging.
        Your logs will be automatically formatted into code, do not need use backticks.
        If possible reproduce the issue with [**Debug Mode** enabled](https://foxxmd.github.io/multi-scrobbler/docs/configuration#debug-mode).
